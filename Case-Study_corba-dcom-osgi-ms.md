Here's a comparison table of these different frameworks and architectural styles. Note that it's a high-level comparison, as each of these is quite complex and can be used in different ways.

| Technology     | Year Introduced | Programming Language | Communication | Distributed Computing | Modularity | Interoperability |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------|-----------------|
| CORBA          | 1991            | Multiple (C++, Java, Python, etc.) | IIOP | Yes | Yes | High (across different languages and systems) |
| OSGi           | 1999            | Java | Direct/Local and Remote Services | Yes | High | High (within Java environment) |
| Jakarta EE     | 1999 (as J2EE)  | Java | RMI, JMS, Web Services | Yes | Medium | High (within Java environment, Web Services for external systems) |
| Microsoft COM+ | 2000            | Primarily .NET languages (C#, VB.NET) | DCOM | Yes | Medium | Medium (High within .NET, through Web Services for external systems) |
| Microservices  | Circa 2011-2012 | Any | Any (HTTP/REST, gRPC, etc.) | Yes | High | Depends on communication protocol used |

Here's what each technology is generally used for:

- **Jakarta EE** (was EJB, J2EE ): Enterprise-level applications, including transaction management, security, and concurrency. It's a superset of the Java SE platform, and includes many APIs for web applications, messaging, and persistence.  
- **CORBA** is a middleware that allows communication between objects in different systems and languages.

- **OSGi** is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries.

- **MS-DCOM** (Microsoft Distributed Component Object Model) is a proprietary Microsoft technology for communication among software components distributed across networked computers. Microsoft COM is released in 1993, it main purpose was to create a binary standard for interoperability between components on the Windows platform. before DCOM each COM only communicate through the same process, DCOM allow them to communicate through the network. the same process means the same memory space, so they can share the same memory space. DCOM is a binary standard, it means it is language independent, it can be used by any language that can compile to binary code. Microsoft also create MSMQ to allow DCOM to communicate through the network. MSMQ is a message broker that allow asynchronous communication.

- **Microservices** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 

In 2000 DCOM involving in .NET and renamed to **MS-COM+**.

This comparison table should give you a basic understanding of how these technologies relate to one another. Keep in mind that their popularity and use cases have evolved over time, so it's essential to consider the specific needs of your project when choosing a technology or architectural style.

**Distributed System:** Supports communication over a network between different machines.

**Language Independence:** The service can be written in and communicate with other services written in any language.

**Dynamic Services:** Services can be added, removed, or updated while the system is running without requiring a system restart.

**Service Discovery:** Services can automatically find and communicate with each other without hard-coded addresses.

**Fault Isolation:** Failure in one service does not directly affect other services.

**Real-time Support:** Provides capabilities for handling real-time requirements, such as deadlines and priorities.

Please note that the term "Microservices" doesn't refer to a specific technology or standard but rather a design style for developing applications as a suite of independently deployable services. Therefore, it doesn't have a specific "year of birth," but the term and the related architectural style started gaining popularity around 2011. The actual characteristics of a microservices-based application can vary significantly depending on the specific technologies used to implement it.
