Note that these technologies aren't directly comparable as they are designed for different purposes. However, I'll focus on a few characteristics and how each one relates to these areas.

|                      | Microservices                 | Service Mesh                              | Serverless                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Basic Concept        | Architecture style dividing applications into small services, each running in its own process and communicating via APIs. | Infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, enabling the decoupling of business logic from network logic. | A cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. |
| Use Case             | Building complex applications as suites of independently deployable services. | Managing, observing, and controlling microservices-based applications. | Event-driven and real-time file processing, extracting data, web application backends, etc. |
| Scalability          | Services can be individually scaled as per demand. | Helps to manage the scalability of microservices. | Scales automatically with demand. |
| Flexibility          | Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. | Provides flexibility in routing and failure handling. | Allows developers to focus on code, without worrying about infrastructure management. |
| Development Language | Services can be written in different programming languages. | Language agnostic, handles service communication irrespective of language. | Depends on the cloud provider, but many languages are typically supported. |
| Deployment           | Each service can be deployed independently. | Typically deployed as a sidecar proxy alongside each service instance. | Deployment is managed by the cloud provider. |
| Failure Isolation    | A failure in one service does not directly impact others. | Provides resilient communication between services, helping to isolate failures. | The failure of one function does not directly affect others. |
| Complexity           | Adds complexity in terms of service coordination and data consistency. | Adds an extra layer of complexity to the infrastructure. | Reduces complexity by abstracting away the server management. |
| Cost                 | Cost depends on infrastructure setup and management. | Overhead cost is added for managing the service mesh. | Pay only for the compute time you consume. |
| Vendor lock-in       | Potentially, depending on the infrastructure and tools used. | Depends on the specific service mesh used. | High potential for vendor lock-in. |

Again, it's important to remember that these technologies often complement each other rather than compete. For instance, a microservices architecture might utilize a service mesh for communication and be deployed on a serverless platform. The best technology (or combination of technologies) depends on the specific needs and context of the project.
