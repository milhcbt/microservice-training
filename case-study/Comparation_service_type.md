Note that these technologies aren't directly comparable as they are designed for different purposes. However, I'll focus on a few characteristics and how each one relates to these areas.

|                      | Microservices                 | Service Mesh                              | Serverless                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Basic Concept        | Architecture style dividing applications into small services, each running in its own process and communicating via APIs. | Infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, enabling the decoupling of business logic from network logic. | A cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. |
| Use Case             | Building complex applications as suites of independently deployable services. | Managing, observing, and controlling microservices-based applications. | Event-driven and real-time file processing, extracting data, web application backends, etc. |
| Scalability          | Services can be individually scaled as per demand. | Helps to manage the scalability of microservices. | Scales automatically with demand. |
| Flexibility          | Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. | Provides flexibility in routing and failure handling. | Allows developers to focus on code, without worrying about infrastructure management. |
| Development Language | Services can be written in different programming languages. | Language agnostic, handles service communication irrespective of language. | Depends on the cloud provider, but many languages are typically supported. |
| Deployment           | Each service can be deployed independently. | Typically deployed as a sidecar proxy alongside each service instance. | Deployment is managed by the cloud provider. |
| Failure Isolation    | A failure in one service does not directly impact others. | Provides resilient communication between services, helping to isolate failures. | The failure of one function does not directly affect others. |
| Complexity           | Adds complexity in terms of service coordination and data consistency. | Adds an extra layer of complexity to the infrastructure. | Reduces complexity by abstracting away the server management. |
| Cost                 | Cost depends on infrastructure setup and management. | Overhead cost is added for managing the service mesh. | Pay only for the compute time you consume. |
| Vendor lock-in       | Potentially, depending on the infrastructure and tools used. | Depends on the specific service mesh used. | High potential for vendor lock-in. |

Again, it's important to remember that these technologies often complement each other rather than compete. For instance, a microservices architecture might utilize a service mesh for communication and be deployed on a serverless platform. The best technology (or combination of technologies) depends on the specific needs and context of the project.

I found some GitHub repositories that contain examples of microservices, serverless and service mesh. Here are some of them:

- **ecommerce-microservices** by mehdihadeli¹: A practical e-commerce microservices, built with .Net 7, Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, Vertical Slice Architecture, Event-Driven Architecture, and the latest technologies.
- **robot-shop** by instana[¹](https://github.com/instana/robot-shop): Sample microservices application for playing with microservices robot performance-monitoring distributed-tracing.
- **microservices-scaffold** by python-microservices¹: Barebone Python Microservices with Flask.
- **serverless/examples** by serverless³: A collection of boilerplates and examples of serverless architectures built with the Serverless Framework on AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Functions, and more.

You can also read this article by Joe Ward[²](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/serverless-microservices-and-service-mesh-oh-my-cd7903bd499d) that explains the concepts and benefits of serverless, microservices and service mesh in detail.
