    "## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)\n",
    "Consider the following Order class:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Order {\n",
    "    // Other methods and fields...\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void processPayment(PaymentMethod paymentMethod, double amount) {\n",
    "        // Process payment\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This class violates SRP because it handles both order management and payment processing. We can refactor this to adhere to SRP as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Order {\n",
    "    // Other methods and fields...\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class PaymentProcessor {\n",

    "        // Process payment\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\n",
    "Suppose we have different types of payment methods (CreditCard, PayPal). If we use a simple if-else statement to handle this, we will violate OCP because adding a new payment method will require us to modify the PaymentProcessor class.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class PaymentProcessor {\n",
    "    public void processPayment(Order order, String paymentMethod, double amount) {\n",
    "        if (\"CreditCard\".equals(paymentMethod)) {\n",
    "            // Process credit card payment\n",
    "        } else if (\"PayPal\".equals(paymentMethod)) {\n",
    "            // Process PayPal payment\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can refactor this to adhere to OCP as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    void processPayment(double amount);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class CreditCard implements PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    public void processPayment(double amount) {\n",
    "        // Process credit card payment\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class PayPal implements PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    public void processPayment(double amount) {\n",
    "        // Process PayPal payment\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public class PaymentProcessor {\n",
    "    public void processPayment(Order order, PaymentMethod paymentMethod, double amount) {\n",
    "        paymentMethod.processPayment(amount);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\n",
    "With the above design, we are adhering to LSP because any class that implements the PaymentMethod interface can be substituted in the PaymentProcessor class without altering its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\n",
    "If we add a refund() method to the PaymentMethod interface, it may not be applicable to all payment methods (e.g., some might not support refunds). This would violate ISP.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    void processPayment(double amount);\n",
    "    void refund(double amount);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can refactor this to adhere to ISP as follows:  \n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    void processPayment(double amount);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "public interface RefundablePaymentMethod extends PaymentMethod {\n",
    "    void refund(double amount);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\n",
    "With the above design, the PaymentProcessor class depends on the PaymentMethod abstraction, not on the concrete CreditCard and PayPal classes, so we're adhering to DIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, adhering to SOLID principles leads to a more flexible, maintainable, and robust design.\n"
